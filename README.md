# ALX_Simple_Quiz
This repository contains the code for a simple interactive webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage features two interactive components:

### 1.Simple Quiz Application.
This quiz presents a question and multiple choice answers. Users can select an answer and receive feedback based on their choice.

### 2. Simple Calculator.
This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two input numbers and displays the result.

## Project Structure
- index.html: Contains the HTML structure for both the quiz and calculator.
- styles.css: Applies styles to the HTML elements for visual presentation.
- quiz.js: Implements the JavaScript functionality for the quiz application.
- calculator.html: Contains the HTML structure for the calculator.
- calculator.css: Applies styles to the calculator's HTML elements.
- calculator.js: Implements the JavaScript functionality for the calculator.

## Instructions
1. Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Files: Open index.html in your web browser to view the combined quiz and calculator application. You can also open calculator.html and index.html separately to view each component individually.

## Functionality

### Quiz Application

- Presents a question ("What is 2 + 2?")
- Offers three multiple-choice answers (4, 22, 3)
- Provides feedback based on the user's selection ("Correct!" or "That's incorrect. Try again!")

### Calculator

- Takes two numbers as input from separate fields.
- Offers buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Calculates the result based on the selected operation and displays it.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement basic HTML elements for structuring webpages.
- Apply CSS styles to enhance visual appearance.
- Utilize JavaScript syntax, control structures, and functions for interactivity.
- Use DOM manipulation to access and modify HTML elements.
- Employ event listeners to respond to user interactions.

This project is a valuable tool for practicing fundamental web development concepts with JavaScript.
